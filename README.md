# Simple Java Calculator

A console-based calculator application built in Java that performs basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with proper error handling.

## Features

- Supports four basic operations: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/)
- Division by zero error handling
- Invalid operator validation
- User-friendly console interface
- Clean switch-case implementation

## Technologies Used

- Java (Core Java)
- Scanner class for user input
- Console-based I/O

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

## Code Structure

- `Calculatorprogram.java` - Main class containing:
  - Input handling using Scanner
  - Switch-case for operator selection
  - Error handling for division by zero and invalid operators

## Possible Enhancements

- Add support for more operations (modulus, power, square root)
- Implement a loop to perform multiple calculations without restarting
- Add history feature to track previous calculations
- Create a GUI version using Swing or JavaFX
- Support for decimal precision formatting
- Add parentheses support for complex expressions

## Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates:
- Basic Java syntax and control structures
- User input handling with Scanner
- Switch-case statements
- Error handling and validation
- Clean code practices
